ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. It leverages historical passenger data, including features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, and more to train predictive models.

The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle, which has become a benchmark for learning classification techniques in machine learning. After thorough data cleaning and preprocessing (done beforehand), the data is split into training and testing sets to ensure a reliable evaluation of model performance.

Four supervised classification models are implemented and compared:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree Classifier

Each model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on both the training and testing datasets. This allows for observing potential overfitting or underfitting. Accuracy metrics for both training and testing phases are printed, and the model with the highest testing accuracy is identified as the best performing.

The project is designed to provide a comparative analysis of these standard machine learning models on a classic classification problem. It serves as a strong foundation for beginners to understand essential steps in an ML pipeline â€” including data preparation, model training, testing, evaluation, and model selection based on performance.
